So imagine a task when you have directory with name fileslocation and this directory contains a lot of subdirs with files.
Now what We want is to copy (move) all files into particular directory with relative name outputfolder for the instance.
So the following script should solve our task:  

WIN CMD:   
   fileslocation > mkdir outputfolder
   fileslocation > for /r %g in (*) do copy "%g" outputfolder

Note that quotes "%g" are needed if spacebars present in file path
